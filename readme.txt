==== How ReviewRoll Works / Important Information ======

ReviewRoll collects and displays data from our secure website https://reviewroll.com

After you install and activate the ReviewRoll plugin using the steps given in the 
Installation area above, you need to visit https://reviewroll.com and get a free account registered. The widget code generated will have to be inserted on your Wordpress installation using the steps provided above.

Please note that all the reviews/testimonials collected will be stored on the ReviewRoll website and not on your Wordpress installation. 

This is because, we need to constantly improve the way Review collection works and add features like Email and SMS integration to make the Review Generation Process more comprehensive. 

The ReviewRoll website is highly secure and we backup your data regularly and we also support multiple locations/websites(including non-Wordpress websites) and also multiple users.
